title: 'MCP Logger'

description: >
  Structured logging for Quicken Loans PHP projects.

  We prefer structured log messages defined on top of PSR-3 Logger Interface
  to allow easier searching of log messages from our log provider.

  This library shares some features with the popular PHP logging library
  Monolog, but we aim to keep this library small and simple and avoid
  unnecessary dependencies for our projects.
