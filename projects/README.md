# Open Source at Quicken Loans
[top]: #oss-projects-and-proposals

This repository is the canonical record of all of Quicken Loans' open source
projects:

  - Proposed (open Pull Requests), and
  - Currently published (accepted Pull Requests).

This repository MUST remain as "internal only" because it will be the place to
propose new projects; and that *can not* be "open".
