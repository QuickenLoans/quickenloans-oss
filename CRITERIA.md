# Criteria
[Criteria]: #criteria

For a project to be published as open source it must answer the following
questions in the positive:

  1. Is it [Non-proprietary]?
  2. Does it follow [Security Best Practices]?
  3. Is it of good/high [Quality]?
  4. Is it [Used]?
  5. Can it be [Licensed for OSS]?


## Non-proprietary
[Non-proprietary]: #non-proprietary

The project does not include anything that would be considered a
"differentiator" for us in the industry.


## Security Best Practices
[Security Best Practices]: #security-best-practices

The project doesn't expose any secure information about Quicken Loans or our
clients; either in code directly or in a way that would allow external access.


## Quality
[Quality]: #quality

This is difficult to define but a good litmus test would be, "would others in
this area of expertise be proud to be associated with?"

For code this could include, but is not limited to:

  - Cleanly written
  - Follows best practices
  - Employs deliberate use of design patterns
  - Well documented
  - Unit tested to a "sufficient" degree
  - Solves a defined and bounded problem


## Used
[Used]: #used

The project is in use and not abandoned.

The full description of "in use" is somewhat dependent on the type of project;
if code, the project should be in "production" use.


## Licensed for OSS
[Licensed for OSS]: #used

The project doesn't rely or build upon any other project that would prevent us
from releasing our project using our preferred - [MIT] - license.
